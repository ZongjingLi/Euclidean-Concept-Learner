# Euclid Concept Learner
 This repo is mainly used for solving the problem proposed by the paper “Geoclidean”.

# Background 
The background of the repo is about a few-shot learning problem: given few pictures of a geometric concept,
how can the model learn it and generalize it to other tasks (discriminative). In this repo, a model is created
to learn the concept model from observation.
